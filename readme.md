# DSW Interview Assessment Project
The goal of this project should be to create a single HTML page (index.html) that resembles the simplified DSW collection pages below as best you can.

[mobile]: collection-page-mobile.png “Mobile Collection Page“

[desktop]: collection-page-desktop.png “Desktop Collection Page”

You can visit the actual DSW.com collection page here to look at hover and state behaviors:
https://www.dsw.com/en/us/category/mens-oxfords/N-1z141hwZ1z128urZ1z141ju?No=0

There is a products.json file that contains data from 10 products that should be output on the collection page.

If you want to provide a short write-up explaning you solutions and implementation approach, please send it in along with a compressed zip file of your project files.

Happy Coding!
